<p>Sub: Appeal to withdraw the Tender Notice issued by Delhi Development Authority to convert Sanjay Vann as an Eco-Tourism hub.</p>
<p>To,</p>
<p>Sh.Anil Baijal</p>
<p>Lt. Governor of GNCT, Delhi &amp; DDA Chairperson&nbsp;</p>
<p>6, Raj Niwas Marg, Ludlow Castle,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civil Lines, New Delhi-110054</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>Shri Arvind Kejriwal,</p>
<p>Hon&rsquo;ble Chief Minister,</p>
<p>Govt of NCT, Delhi.</p>

<p>This is in reference to citizens&rsquo; appeal to withdraw the Tender Notification issued by Delhi Development Authority to convert the Sanjay Vann area as an Eco-Tourism Hub. Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;DDA&rdquo;) is planning to utilize the forest area for recreational purposes. They are further planning to introduce Rock climbing, paragliding, aerial trails (canopy tours, ziplines, valley crossing, Burma bridge crossing), forest safari, leisure cycling, camping, and picnic spots, star gazing, bird watching, guided nature tours, and flora and fauna observation trips are some of the activities proposed by the DDA.</p>
<p>Sanjay Vann is one of the few untouched green lungs of the capital but this proposed Eco-Tourism by DDA is inviting more disaster to the National Capital&rsquo;s already dismal environmental record. <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-plans-to-develop-sanjay-Vann-as-ecotourism-hub-with-rock-climbing-safari-aerial-trails-101631901146386.html">https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-plans-to-develop-sanjay-Vann-as-ecotourism-hub-with-rock-climbing-safari-aerial-trails-101631901146386.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Sanjay Vann </strong>is a sprawling city forest area near&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasant_Kunj">Vasant Kunj</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrauli">Mehrauli</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi">Delhi</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a>. It is spread over an area of 443&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre">acres</a>. It is one of the most thickly wooded areas of the city&rsquo;s green lungs.</p>
<p>Sprawling over a large forest area near Vasant Kunj in South Delhi, Sanjay Vann is a thickly wooded area that serves as the city&rsquo;s green lungs. Stretching over 3 sq. km of area, the forest is home to several avifauna species and diverse varieties of trees. Because of the same, Sanjay Vann is frequented by a lot of birdwatchers and also cyclists who come here to ride in and breathe fresh air in the morning.</p>
<p>Sanjay Vann is a pleasant escape into nature from the chaos and din of the city. Considered to be a favorite of the naturalists, the forest is home to rich wildlife. Aside from birds that include Eurasian golden oriole, purple sunbird, Asian koel, Brahminy starling, Indian silverbill, white-throated kingfisher, Grey-breasted Prinia, crested honey buzzard, rufous treepie, and Indian paradise flycatcher, etc., the forest also conserves habitat for jackals, snakes, nilgais and several species of butterflies, etc.</p>
<p>The forest, which is part of the Mehrauli South Central Ridge, has undergone severe degradation in recent times with the proliferation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopis_juliflora"><em>Prosopis juliflora</em></a>&nbsp;tree which is non-endemic to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aravalli_Range">Aravalli Ranges</a>&nbsp;and has caused depletion of the groundwater level, killing native flora and changing the natural soil characteristics of the Aravallis. Sewage water and effluent which is discharged into Sanjay Vann has also affected this green belt in the Capital.</p>
<p>As per the news report, the base of the trees at Sanjay Vann is already choking with concrete around it. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/concrete-choking-sanjay-Vann-trees-activist/articleshow/69817177.cms">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/concrete-choking-sanjay-Vann-trees-activist/articleshow/69817177.cms</a></p>
<p>The recent proposal of DDA to convert Sanjay Vann into an Eco-Tourism hub will deteriorate the only left green belts of Delhi. The National Capital has already made international headlines for its poor air quality every year. Despite making headlines and installing smog towers, every measure to contain has failed miserably and if the remaining green belts are disturbed it will completely ruin everything. <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/new-who-standards-for-air-quality-delhi-needs-to-accelerate-action-say-experts/ar-AAOJgt5">https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/new-who-standards-for-air-quality-delhi-needs-to-accelerate-action-say-experts/ar-AAOJgt5</a></p>
<p>Experts have already warned that &ldquo;<em>Forest areas should be left untouched, as we don&rsquo;t have a lot of genuine forest area left in the capital city. Nature trails are already there in Sanjay Vann and anything beyond that would be an invasion of forest land.&rdquo; </em>Moreover, there is already a lot of garbage in terms of plastic waste that is thrown in the forests of Sanjay Vann which remains there with no efforts by the local authorities to clean them. Several environmental groups, nature lovers, citizens from every walk of life have taken it upon themselves to save the city&rsquo;s green belts by initiating regular weekly clean-up drives to clean the Sanjay Vann. Some of the testimonials of these nature warriors will prove that garbage is openly thrown at Sanjay Vann clearly damaging the forests with no measures or steps taken by the authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>One of the college students from a Delhi college who recently went for her 1</em><em>st</em><em> clean-up drive at Sanjay Vann shared that she was shocked to see so much non-biodegradable waste.</em></p>
<p>Another group of volunteers stated that they have been regularly taking morning walks in Sanjay Vann and decided to clean up the garbage themselves when they did not see any action from the civic authorities. This group of volunteers has stated that since 2019, they have removed 12.685 kg of non-biodegradable waste from Sanjay Vann. This is a proven fact that Sanjay Vann is an environmentally sensitive area that needs to be protected at any cost from any further damage.</p>
<p>I, myself, am a resident of Delhi who regularly visits Sanjay Vann for morning walks and for weekend nature outings and have been part of the clean-up drives organized by the volunteers over there. It breaks my heart and soul to see such a disastrous step by the DDA to destroy the beautiful and the only natural green belt left in Delhi. It is even more soul-wrenching to see that the South Delhi area has considerably lost all the green belts and the authorities at DDA are now going to let the magnificence of nature called Sanjay Vann, be destroyed. I urge you to take urgent and immediate steps to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Therefore, I most humbly request you that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Direct the Delhi Development Authority to recall the Tender Notice issued for Eco-Tourism at Sanjay Vann.</li>
<li>Direct South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to do proper clean-up of the Sanjay Vann.</li>
<li>Direct SDMC to take strict action against the spilling of garbage, plastic waste at Sanjay Vann.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Direct SDMC to conduct regular awareness campaigns on sustainability, the climate crisis, and the importance of Sanjay Vann for the national capital</li>
<li>Install new waste bins by replacing the old and damaged ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eagerly anticipating an immediate, careful, and most urgent consideration of the above matter from your end.</p>
<p>In Solidarity</p>
<p>An environmentally conscious and concerned citizen.</p>
